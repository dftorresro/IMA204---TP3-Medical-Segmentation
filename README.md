# IMA204---TP3-Medical-Segmentation

Images to use are provided in a zip file called **data.zip** to install in your local directory from where you are running this notebook.

The goal of this practical session is to push K-means segmentation method as a pre-segmentation tool on different types of medical images: CT scans for the segmentation of kidneys and tumors, MRI for the corpus callosum in the brain , temporal sequences of MRI images for segmentation of the myocardium.

You are provided with pre-processing ideas. 
You will have to adjust a pipeline for **AT LEAST** one application (kidney/tumor, corpus callosum or heart).

You have to submit your code and comment your results. 

**Deadline**: You will have to upload a single jupyter notebook .ipynb with your answers (code + text) before the deadline (please check on Ecampus/Moodle). 

**The uploaded file should be named 'TP_SegMedImage_YOURSURNAME.ipynb'.** 

**RUN THE WHOLE NOTEBOOK FIRST TO GET A FULL OVERVIEW OF USE-CASES AND THE NOTION OF HYPERPARAMETERS.**
